# PersonalityPredictionUsingMBTI-Dataset

With the growth of industry 4.0, the need for talent management is at its peak. Many companies are identifying ways to get the best talent in the market. It’s been said that the company that can acquire a good talent will win the race. Having said that talent management is not an easy task and there are many ways companies identify talent as good. One very popular mechanism is a personality test using Myers Briggs test. In personality typology, the Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) is a self-reporting questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. The test attempts to assign four categories: introversion or extraversion, sensing or intuition, thinking or feeling, judging or perceiving. One letter from each category is taken to produce a four-letter test result, such as "INTJ" or "ESFP". So, for example, someone who prefers introversion, intuition, thinking, and perceiving would be labeled an INTP in the MBTI system.

This dataset contains over 8600 rows of data, on each row is a person’s:
•	Type (This person 4 letter MBTI code/type)
•	A section of each of the last 50 things they have posted (Each entry separated by "|||" (3 pipe characters))

For this project, the aim is to identify the personality type of a person from the given post on the internet.

Project Outcomes
•	Explore the various ways for data preprocessing
•	Explore various ways that data can be trained
•	Identify the best model to train the data
•	Train the natural language processing-based model to predict the personality type
•	Predict the answers to new questions that are not part of training.
